This project visually details the transition of current (03/10/2024) Milwaukee Bucks centre Brook Lopez's shot diet throughout the duration of his career as of (03/10/2024). His growth from a post scoring big into an elite 3&D centre is remarkable to say the least and is even more beautiful on the shot chart I've made.
